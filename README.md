# Genome in 3D and beyond: next of the next-generation sequencing technologies

An overview presentation of chromatin conformation capture technologies and analysis methods.

## Abstract

Sequencing of the human genome provided a wealth of knowledge about genome regulation. However, the genome is much more than a linear sequence of nucleotides comprising DNA. The recent development of genome sequencing methods gave rise to technologies able to capture the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the genome. They revealed the well-organized fractal globule-like folding of the genome, the presence of chromosome territories, the formation of isolated units of genomic interactions termed Topologically Associated Domains and chromatin loops. These 3D structures proved to be indispensable for orchestrating numerous genomic processes. Changes in the 3D structure of the genome are emerging as hallmarks of cancer and other diseases. This presentation will review chromatin conformation capture technologies and methods for analyzing the 3D structure of the genome.
